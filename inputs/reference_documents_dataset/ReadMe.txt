For SAS users only:
Due to limitations within SAS, there is a limit of 4,096 formats or informats that can be used in a single procedure or data step. The GSS 2021 data set exceeds this formats limit. In order to circumvent errors associated with this limitation, the GSS team divided the formats associated with GSS 2021 into two separate format libraries. These formats can be accessed with the data set by using the code provided in Appendix B of the GSS 2021 Codebook.
